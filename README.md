# etch-a-sketch
Browser version of a sketchpad made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, made as part of Odin Project curriculum.

How to use:
The webpage will launch a 16 x 16 grid of squares by default.

You can hover the mouse over the grid of squares to sketch anything that you'd like.
The squares gradually turn darker with each hover (until it turns completely black).

There is an input box present to change the number of squares on each side of the square grid. You may input a value from 1 to 100, to create from a 1x1 up to a 100x100 square grid.
(E.g. You would like to change from the default 16x16 square grid to a 50x50 square grid, just input 50 into the input box and press the "Confirm" button. The square grid will be updated with the corresponding number of squares on each side.)
Note: Inputting an invalid value will prompt you to enter a correct value instead. The square grid will remain unchanged.

You may also use the "Clear" button located below the square grid to clear your current sketch on the grid.
